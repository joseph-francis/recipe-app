## Recipe app implementation

### Overview

This application can be cloned and run locally as-is. There are no external dependencies; the app is built with Apple-provided technologies.

### What it does
On launch, the app will fetch meals from "Dessert" category - based on this endpoint (https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert). Tapping on each item pulls up a detail screen where it shows the instructions, ingredients & measurements to prepare the meal.
